```mdx
---
title: "Your Post Title"
date: "2024-01-20"
author: "Your Name"
image: "https://example.com/banner.jpg"
preview: "A short description of your post"
tags: ["javascript", "tutorial", "nextjs"]
---

# Your Post Title

Your content here with full Markdown support...
```

### Supported Features

- **Markdown syntax**: Headers, lists, links, images, blockquotes
- **Code blocks with syntax highlighting**: JavaScript, Python, and more
- **Footnotes**: Use `[^1]` for references
- **Tags**: Categorize posts with tags
- **Comments**: Giscus integration for discussions
- **File downloads**: Use the `FileDownload` component

### Configuring Giscus Comments

To enable comments:

1. Set up Giscus for your repository at [giscus.app](https://giscus.app)
2. Update the `pages/blog/[id].jsx` file with your `repoId` and `categoryId`

### Theme Customization

The site uses a coffee-inspired color palette defined in `tailwind.config.js`. The theme can be toggled between light and dark modes using the coffee cup/moon button in the header.
