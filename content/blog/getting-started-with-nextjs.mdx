# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a powerful React framework that makes building web applications easier and more efficient. In this post, we'll explore the basics of Next.js and why it's become so popular.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js provides several key features out of the box:

1. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** - Improved performance and SEO
2. **Static Site Generation (SSG)** - Lightning-fast page loads
3. **File-based Routing** - Intuitive project structure
4. **API Routes** - Build your backend alongside your frontend
5. **Image Optimization** - Automatic image optimization

## Creating Your First Next.js App

Getting started is simple:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

This creates a new Next.js application with all the necessary configuration.

## File-Based Routing

One of Next.js's best features is its file-based routing system. Here's how it works:

```
pages/
  index.js       -> /
  about.js       -> /about
  blog/
    index.js     -> /blog
    [id].js      -> /blog/:id
```

## Creating a Simple Page

Here's a basic Next.js page component:

```jsx
import Head from "next/head";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        <title>My Next.js App</title>
      </Head>
      <main>
        <h1>Welcome to Next.js!</h1>
        <p>This is a simple page component.</p>
      </main>
    </>
  );
}
```

## Data Fetching

Next.js provides several methods for fetching data:

### Static Generation with getStaticProps

```javascript
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const data = await fetchData();

  return {
    props: {
      data,
    },
  };
}
```

### Server-Side Rendering with getServerSideProps

```javascript
export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const data = await fetchData(context.params.id);

  return {
    props: {
      data,
    },
  };
}
```

## Styling Options

Next.js supports various styling approaches:

- **CSS Modules** - Scoped CSS files
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **Styled Components** - CSS-in-JS
- **Sass** - CSS preprocessor

## Performance Optimization

Next.js automatically optimizes your application:

- Code splitting for faster page loads
- Image optimization with the `next/image` component
- Font optimization
- Automatic static optimization

## Deployment

Deploying a Next.js app is straightforward, especially with Vercel:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

Or deploy to Vercel with a single command:

```bash
vercel
```

## Conclusion

Next.js is an excellent choice for building modern web applications. Its combination of performance, developer experience, and built-in features makes it a go-to framework for React developers.
