# Welcome to the New MDX Blog System

I'm excited to introduce the completely revamped blog system! This new setup uses **MDX** (Markdown + JSX), which gives us the best of both worlds: the simplicity of Markdown with the power of React components.

## What's New?

### 1. Full MDX Support

You can now write blog posts in Markdown with full support for:

- **Bold** and _italic_ text
- Lists and nested items
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- And much more!

### 2. Syntax Highlighting

Code blocks now have proper syntax highlighting. Here's an example in JavaScript:

```javascript
const greeting = (name) => {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
  return `Welcome to the blog!`;
};

greeting("Reader");
```

And here's some Python:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

# Generate first 10 Fibonacci numbers
for i in range(10):
    print(fibonacci(i))
```

### 3. Tags and Filtering

Each post can have tags for easy categorization and filtering. This post is tagged with: `mdx`, `blog`, `javascript`, and `nextjs`.

### 4. Coffee-Inspired Theme

The site now features a beautiful coffee palette for the light theme, with warm, inviting colors that are easy on the eyes. Dark mode is still available for those who prefer it!

## Markdown Features

### Blockquotes

> "The best way to predict the future is to invent it."
> â€” Alan Kay

### Lists

**Unordered lists:**

- Coffee
- Tea
- Hot chocolate

**Ordered lists:**

1. Write content in MDX
2. Add frontmatter metadata
3. Publish!

### Links and Images

You can add [links to other sites](https://nextjs.org) easily.

## What's Coming Next?

- Comment system integration with Giscus
- File download widgets for sharing resources
- Table of contents for longer posts
- And more improvements!

Stay tuned for more content and features!
